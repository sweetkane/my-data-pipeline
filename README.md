## Technical details
- Uses a LOT of AWS services
  - Cloudformation, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, KMS, SES, ECS, Route 53, Cloudfront
- Serverless website design
  - Subscription page uses S3, Cloudfront with SSL, and Route 53 to create a serverless website with HTTPS
- Signed URLs
  - Unsubscribe button uses signed URLs so users can only unsubscribe their own account
  - URLs are encrypted/decrypted with KMS
- Containerized Lambda
  - Newsletter is sent by a lambda function in an ECS container
    - (If I were to do it again I would use S3 and lambda layers tbh)
  - Lambda is triggered by an EventBridge cron job
  - Source code uses a "plugin" architecture making it easy to add news sources and output types
  - Gets headlines from RSS feeds, and then summarizes them with Langchain-OpenAI
