# ðŸ¤–RoboNewsðŸ¤– [![Button Shield]][Shield]
RoboNews is a serverless email newsletter that delivers weekly news about AI and LLMs, written by an LLM!

## Technical details
- Uses a LOT of AWS services
  - Cloudformation, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, KMS, SES, ECS, Route 53, Cloudfront
- Serverless design
  - Subscription page uses S3, Cloudfront, Certificate Manager, and Route 53 to create a serverless website with HTTPS
- One-Click Deployment
  - The project includes a deployment script which uses the AWS CLI to push source code to ECS and S3, and then deploys the Cloudformation template, so that almost any change to the project can be shipped with the same command
  - If I were to do it again I'd probably use CDK instead of the CLI
  - A future addition could be a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys changes when they're pushed to origin
- Signed URLs
  - Unsubscribe button uses signed URLs so users can only unsubscribe their own account
  - URLs are encrypted/decrypted with KMS
- Containerized Lambda
- Uses a LOT of AWS services
  - Cloudformation, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, KMS, SES, ECS, Route 53, Cloudfront
- Serverless website design
  - Subscription page uses S3, Cloudfront with SSL, and Route 53 to create a serverless website with HTTPS
- Signed URLs
  - Unsubscribe button uses signed URLs so users can only unsubscribe their own account
  - URLs are encrypted/decrypted with KMS
- Containerized Lambda
  - Newsletter is sent by a lambda function in an ECS container
    - If I were to do it again I would use S3 and lambda layers tbh
  - Lambda is triggered by an EventBridge cron job
  - Source code uses a "plugin" architecture making it easy to add news sources and output types
  - Gets headlines from RSS feeds, and then summarizes them with Langchain-OpenAI
